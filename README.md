# puddletag-AppImage

Unofficial AppImage of puddletag. Made it since the maintainer doesn't want to create one. [1](https://github.com/puddletag/puddletag/issues/919#issuecomment-2211231931) [2](https://github.com/puddletag/puddletag/issues/408#issuecomment-2026230760)

**This AppImage bundles everything and should work on any linux distro, even on musl based ones.**

It is possible that this appimage may fail to work with appimagelauncher, since appimagelauncher is pretty much dead I recommend this alternative: https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM

This appimage works without `fuse2` as it can use `fuse3` instead.
